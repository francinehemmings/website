<h2>Profile of Francine Hemmings, with a diploma in osteopathy</h2>

Maintaining health in harmony with nature has always been at the center of 
her being.

She has been looking for ways to optimize her physical health and well-being 
in order to share the results of her beneficial experiences with her patients.

Her conclusion? Food, the outdoors and peace of mind are essential to a healthy
balance. The Osteopathy method has been part of her life journey in search of
better physical health and greater well-being.

Osteopathy is an approach to healing that is manual, gentle and powerful. It 
accompanies the body in its quest to find its own means of self-healing. Francine
embarked on the rigorous learning that this 7 year training program requires in order to offer today with pleasure the benefits of a medicine more than a century 
old and proven in its effectiveness.

She has written a memoir on how to achieve an optimal state of mind in her 
professional life and especially in her role as an advocate for healing and 
physical autonomy. The great osteopath founders, contemporary and current, have 
inspired her throughout her career.

Always attracted to nature, it is in Estrie that she found her nest. She currently
practices her profession in the village of Mansonville
